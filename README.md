# 🌍 Life Expectancy vs GDP - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **life expectancy** and **GDP per capita** across six different countries, using Python and common data analysis libraries.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `life_expectancy.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `data.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `/plots` – Folder containing generated visualizations (optional)

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical summaries
- Data visualization (scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps)
- Correlation analysis between economic indicators and health outcomes

## 🚀 Key Findings

- A positive correlation exists between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
- Country-specific differences show how economic development impacts public health.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to perform EDA on real-world data
- Creating clear visualizations for correlation insights
- Improving communication of analytical findings through notebooks

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Include more countries and timeframes
- Apply regression models for predictive analysis
- Add interactive visualizations using Plotly or Dash
